Forked the Simple Contacts app for an assignment to write UI tests on. You can find more about 
the app <a href='https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-Contacts'>here on it's github page.</a>

A simple app for creating or managing your contacts from any source. The contacts can be stored on your device only, but also synchronized via Google, or other accounts. You can display your favorite contacts on a separate list.
